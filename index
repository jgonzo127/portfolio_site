		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>I&#39m a new Front End web designer interested in learning as much as I can about the art of coding. The idea of combining design and content on something as powerful and frequently used as the web is fascinating to me. </p>
		
		<p>Working in the mysterious realm of the internet is an idea that dawned on me within the last year or so. I didn't realize how much time myself and everyone around me relied on the internet for so many things. Of course I need to learn how to make stuff on the internet!</p>
		
		<p>Friendship, stability, and hard work are all very important to me. I feel that one&#39s greatest challenge lies within one&#39s self, and overcoming that challenge is the most rewarding of lifelong goals.
